Steps to create keys
	ssh-keygen –t rsa
	(default settings are good, just press enter a lot)
	scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub $REMOTEUSER@$REMOTEHOST:$USER_at_$HOST.pub
	ssh $REMOTEUSER@$REMOTEHOST
	(Enter password)
	mkdir -p .ssh
	mv $USER_at_$HOST.pub .ssh/
	cd .ssh
	cp $USER_at_$HOST authorized_keys
	chmod og-rwx authorized_keys
	(Ctrl-d to log out, and see if you can log in again)


If you want multiple account to have passwordless access.

	(Create key and copy like above)
	(Instead of cp … do)
	cat $USER_at_$HOST.pub >> authorized_keys
	(And if you should ever use a single > instead of >> you are screwed. Don’t do that.)
